A simple FiveM IP Address grabber made in C++.

Do you want to know the beautiful thing?
I thought you could get the server IP only after the acceptance by the server. Instead you can grab even if you are banned or if you are not whitelisted. You have to try to connect and the ip will be stored in a global variable. To view just click the DEL button and the program will save the IP and port in a text file. Soon I will change the code, I did it in 5 minutes and now I'm sleepy. I don't know if it's detected but I don't think so.
Obviously there are other ways to get the ip, the most used is in the net.dll module.
In this project we are going to put a hook inside the Windows API send Unfortunately FiveM forgot to encrypt the buffer when requesting the connection to the xD server
Compile in release 64 and inject.
